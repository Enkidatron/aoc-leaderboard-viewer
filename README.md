AllInOne:
- show "cursor-tick" on the y-axis like in OneForEachMember
- show ticks for all the data points the currently hovered x-line
                                          (the (day,star) tuple)
- on hover of names in legend, show only the one hovered member

OneForEachMember:
- in addition to the "cursor-tick", show tick for the currently hovered x-line 
- don't hover on other plots than the one your mouse is on!
